## 🔍 Project Workflow

### 🧼 Step 1: Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values
- Fixed data types
- Removed duplicates
- Standardized coffee names and payment entries

### 📊 Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Coffee popularity analysis
- Sales distribution by weekday and hour
- Monthly sales trends by coffee type

### 🤖 Step 3: Machine Learning
- Linear Regression model to predict `money` (sales amount)
- Used features: `coffee_name`, `cash_type`, `day`, and `hour`
- Evaluation: MSE and R² score

### 📈 Step 4: Insights
- Most popular: **Latte** and **Americano with Milk**
- Peak hours: **10 AM** and **7 PM**
- Highest sales on **Tuesday**
- Over **90%** payments made via **card**
